The second player makes their guess. The first lifts the cup — the result is visible. The first player can't swap the coin (the photo is already recorded), and the second couldn't peek (the coin was hidden). In our game, instead of a photo we use a mathematical \"fingerprint\" recorded on the blockchain.",
